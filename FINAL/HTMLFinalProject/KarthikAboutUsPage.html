        <h3>What We Do</h3>
          <hr>
            <p>The Wish Fountain is an organisation that has the aim of helping disadvantaged and sick children across Ireland, this includes children that are terminally ill or severely disadvantaged kids that did not get the same kind of opportunities as others like them.</p>
            <p>What we do for these kids is try and provide them with something to look forward to by organising events and surprises for them and their families. We try and create memories for the children and the families to help distract them from their current situation. We have 100s of volunteers that are kind enough to help us with achieving this goal and have also raised millions through fundraising held by our lovely volunteers and donations from the many kind people that want to help us</p>
            <p>We have done group trips where we take the the kids together to places such as Disneyland and Universal Studios to make memories with their families and to enjoy themselves. We have some very kindhearted volunteers there that help the kids enjoy themselves and make sure it is a truly magical experience.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <hr>
          <p>The Wish Fountain Was Established on the 26th of June 1975 by John Walsh in Dublin with the intention of helping the very sick and severely disadvantaged children</p>
          <p>John was a very wealthy man and had many businesses that traded internationally. He decided to start this foundation when his 7 year old son Steve fell severely ill. John wanted to create memories and spend as much time as he could with his son as he knew that he was going to lose him. John lost Steve later that year and was devestated.</p>
          <p>He then created the Wish Fountain so that families could create everlasting memories with their children who are facing life threatening medical conditions. He also wanted to show severely disadvanted and abandoned kids that there was hope and that things will get better as life goes on</p>
